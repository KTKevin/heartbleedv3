#README

Note: I tried to delete the index page and rewrite it with my button app, it worked when i ran the html code on my browser but I have not tested if it works when deployed on heroku; the secondpage.html should be what index.html originally was. do a diff with your file and if there's any errors fix them or just go ahead and replace it with cheyenne's version of the game.
